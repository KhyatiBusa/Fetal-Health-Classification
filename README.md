# Fetal-Health-Classification
This project analyzes CTG data to classify fetal health as "Normal" or "At Risk," identifying key factors like heart rate variability. The goal is to support early interventions and reduce child mortality, though limitations include dataset scope and loss of detail from simplifying the classification.
